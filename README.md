## Challenges Faced

A challenge that I have faced during the development setup is that I had a problem where the appEntry.js is not being found because i have put the app.js inside the screens directory but it is supposed to be in the root directory.

## Learning Outcomes

I have learned how to set up a react-native setup for development.
